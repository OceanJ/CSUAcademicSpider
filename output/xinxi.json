Researchers from both academia and industries have put much effort in achieving this goal. Starting from some introduction of the basics of wireless power transfer (WPT) covering its applications and principles the Talk moves on to a brand new and more exciting field of wireless information and energy cooperation, i.e., transmitting information and energy simultaneously and wirelessly. Again some basic principles are presented here including the theoretical upper and lower bounds for energy consumption used by information delivery. Finally the Talk presents a fair power splitting algorithm proposed by the Speaker and his Team. \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aKun Yang (\u6768\u9cb2) obtained his PhD from the Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering of University College London (UCL), UK, and his MSc and BSc degrees were both from Jilin University.

The number of reports is relatively small at present, but there is an upward trend. The membership function of a T2 fuzzy set is three-dimensional whereas that of a T1 fuzzy set is two dimensional. The new third dimension membership function enables the T2 fuzzy set to characterize the membership function uncertainties in a quantitative manner. Based on T2 fuzzy control results from their lab-scale applications, experiments, and simulations, some authors have claimed in the literature that the T2 fuzzy controllers can outperform the T1 fuzzy controllers in terms of control performance. Theoretical exploration in this regard is necessary because experiment-based observations have inherent limitations \u2013 they cannot be comprehensive and can even sometimes be incorrect. Such theoretical development, however, is still in its infancy.  \r\nA T2 fuzzy controller, like its T1 counterparts, is currently viewed and treated by many fuzzy control practitioners and researchers as a black box that is a function generator which produces a desired nonlinear mapping between input and output of the controller (we call suchmapping an analytical structure). The analytical structure's implicit mathematical representation linking output variableuwith input variable vectorx,, is a nonlinear control solution being sought. In this presentation, I will demonstrate the latest new techniques capable of deriving theexplicitmathematical representation offor some common interval T2 fuzzy controllers. Connections between the resulting analytical structures and the conventional nonlinear controllers (e.g., the PID controller) will be shown and insightful analyses will be provided.of the T2 fuzzy controllers will be compared with those of the comparable T1 fuzzy controllers and their relative advantages and disadvantages will be exposed. I will not only cover control performance but system complexities as well (e.g., the number of design parameters), as the latter alone often determines the fate of a controller in real-world applications.  \r\nHao Ying\u6559\u6388\u82f1\u6587\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1a \r\nDr. Hao Ying is a professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Wayne State University, USA.

Therefore, we are facing more serious threats to the dependability of systems and information due to problems caused by accidental events such as human mistakes and physical malfunctions or by intentional behavior being either malicious or non-malicious. In this talk, we will discuss some example threats and challenges for systems requiring high dependability. We then give views of future directions in research on the dependability of networked systems.\r\n\r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aSy-Yen Kuo is a Distinguished Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan.

When they graduate, the universities ask them to do a survey to give feedback to their schools.The most common complain about the Engineering curriculum is the lack of \u201cpractical courses\u201d. \u00a0 \r\nInUnited States, the Federal government does not decide the education curricula for any level of schools. The standards and requirements for Engineering colleges are set by a non-government accreditation organization\u2014ABET.The members of ABET consist most of the professional engineer associations, such as IEEE, ASME, AIAA, etc. The curriculum standards and requirements for each Engineering degree program are decided by the corresponding engineer association. \u00a0 \r\nThe college education inUnitedStateis leaning toward \u201cgeneral education\u201d, not \u201cvocational education\u201d. This philosophy originated from the 17-centuryWestern Europeuniversities.The ABET accreditation criteria consist: \u201cThe students should be able to apply mathematics, science, and engineering principles (to solve engineering problems).\u201d \u00a0 \r\nThis talk starts with the reviewing of the American education history, from colonial era to the 20thCentury. The evolution of the Engineering education has to do with the needs of the nation at different times in the American history.An introduction of the ABET accreditation process will also be included. \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aDr. Lin received his PhD in Aerospace Engineering fromUniversityofMichiganin 1990.In the same year, he joined University of Central Florida (UCF) as a joint-faculty between Institute for Simulation and Training (IST) and Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE).

It can significantly simplify the network management and offer a programmable and flexible network architecture. Originally, SDN is designed for wired networks, such as data center network and campus LAN. Since the architecture is generic, it can be applied to wireless networks also. In the past several years, SDN has now been investigated for the major forms of wireless networks, e.g., cellular networks, WLANs, WSNs, etc. Similar to wired implementations, software defined wireless networks can also bring flexibility, programmability, efficiency, and evolvability to wireless networks. Meanwhile, it provides more opportunities and raises many new challenges have been due to the unique features of wireless communication, such as limited spectrum, and unstable wireless channel. In this talk, I will introduce the recent advances in software defined wireless networks. I will highlight key issues and discuss the opportunities that SDN may bring and future research directions. Finally, I will briefly describe our recent work on software defined vehicle networks. \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aDr. Cao is currently a chair professor and head of the Department of Computing at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong.

This is especially so with multiple Cloud providers with various quality of service levels. The question we address in this talk is how to provision resources to workflow-based applications where resource failures in hybrid Cloud computing systems can and do arise. We also discuss our latest work that takes into account the workload models and failure correlations to schedule workflow applications to appropriate Cloud providers. Using failure traces and workload models, we evaluated the performance and monetary cost of the proposed policies.\r\n\r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aDr. Jemal H.

In comparison with continuous control of chaos, the discontinuous control method, which includes impulsive control, occasional bang-bang control, occasional proportional feedback and intermittent control, has attracted more interest recently due to its easy implementation in engineering control. In this talk, the recent development of discontinuous control including impulsive and intermittent control will be addressed.  \r\nTitle 2:Efficient Computation for Sparse Load Shifting in Demand Side Management(Mr. Li)  \r\nAbstract 2:In this talk, it introduces a distributed algorithm for sparse load shifting in demand-side management with a focus on the scheduling problem of residential smart appliances. Although there are many game theoretic models for the demand-side management problem, the computational efficiency of finding Nash equilibrium that globally minimizes the total energy consumption cost and the peak-to-average ratio is still an outstanding issue. We develop a bidirectional framework for solving the demand-side management problem in a distributed way to substantially improve the search efficiency. A Newton method is employed to accelerate the centralized coordination of demand side management strategies that superlinearly converge to a better Nash equilibrium minimizing the peak-to-average ratio. Furthermore, dual fast gradient and convex relaxation are applied to tackle the sub-problem for customers' best response, which is able to relieve customers' discomfort from load shifting or interrupting. Detailed results from illustrative case studies are presented and discussed, which shows the costs of energy consumption and daily peak demand by our algorithm are reduced. Finally, some conclusions are drawn.  \r\n\u9ec4\u5ef7\u6587\u6559\u6388\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1a\u9ec4\u5ef7\u6587\u6559\u6388\u73b0\u4efb\u7f8e\u56fd\u5fb7\u5dde\u519c\u5de5\u5927\u5b66\u5361\u5854\u5c14\u5206\u6821\u6559\u6388\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4ece\u4e8b\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u8def\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u91cd\u8981\u520a\u7269\u6216\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e0a\u53d1\u8868\u76f8\u5173\u5b66\u672f\u8bba\u6587200\u4f59\u7bc7\uff0c\u4e3b\u6301\u6216\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3b\u6301\u5361\u5854\u5c14\u56fd\u5bb6\u4f18\u5148\u8d44\u52a9\u57fa\u91d1\u9879\u76ee5\u9879\uff0c\u662f\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u540c\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u56fd\u9645\u77e5\u540d\u5b66\u8005\uff0c\u66fe\u62c5\u4efb10\u591a\u4e2a\u56fd\u9645\u91cd\u8981\u4f1a\u8bae\u7684\u5206\u4f1a\u4e3b\u5e2d\u6216\u7a0b\u5e8f\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u59d4\u5458\uff0c\u73b0\u62c5\u4efbIEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u56fd\u9645\u5b66\u672f\u671f\u520a\u7f16\u59d4\uff0c\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u6570\u5b66\u4f1a\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u4f1a\u4f1a\u5458\u3002  \r\n \u674e\u8d85\u6770\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aMr. Li\u4e8e2007\u30012011\u5e74\u5728\u91cd\u5e86\u5927\u5b66\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97\u7535\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u5b66\u58eb\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7855\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u7687\u5bb6\u58a8\u5c14\u672c\u5927\u5b66\u653b\u8bfb\u535a\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\u3002\u4ed6\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5174\u8da3\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u53d1\u8868\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u91cd\u8981\u5b66\u672f\u671f\u520a\u6216\u4f1a\u8bae20\u4f59\u7bc7\uff0cSCI\u671f\u520a10\u4f59\u7bc7\uff0c\u5305\u62ecIEEE Transactions onIndustrial Informatics(2014\u5e74\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u5b50\uff1a8.785),IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems\u7b49\u3002 ", "type": "\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u7c7b"},

By means of software tools, the application of these methods is facilitated. Over the last about half a century, CAPE (computer aided process engineering) tools have found their way into process engineering. E.g. nowadays it is unthinkable to design a plant without a simulation in a flow sheet package or its control strategies without modelling and control design tools.  \r\nThe integration of design and control, control and scheduling and design, control and scheduling, all have been core PSE challenges. While significant progress has been achieved over the years, it is fair to say that at the moment there is not a generally accepted methodology and/or \u201cprotocol\u201d for such an integration - it is also interesting to note that currently, there is not a commercially available software [or even in a prototype form] system to fully support such an activity. But there are many more applications of PSE in industry. \u00a0 \r\nIn this paper a (Finnish) perspective on industrially applied PSE is discussed. Finally industrial case studies in the area of process modelling, control and monitoring as well as fault diagnosis by the author\u2019s group are presented and evaluated. \u00a0 \r\nSirkka-Liisa J\u00e4ms\u00e4-Jounela\u6559\u6388\u82f1\u6587\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1a \r\nSirkka-Liisa J\u00e4ms\u00e4-Jounela graduated from Oulu University of Technology in 1978 where she majored in process control.

A major challenge in neuroimaging visualization is how to integrate structural, functional and connectivity data to form a comprehensive visual context for data exploration, quality control, and hypothesis discovery. In this talk I will present some of our recent work on integrated visualization solution for brain imaging data by combining scientific and information visualization techniques within the context of brain anatomic structures. Several techniques will be discussed including (1) a multi-modal neuroimaging visualization tool, (2) a new surface texture technique for attribute mapping and disease features detection, (3) a new spherical volume rendering technique for generating interactive brain maps, and (4) a multi-graph technique for feature detection. This integrated visualization solution can help neuroscientists identify correlated brain regions, their activity patterns, and disease related brain connection features and imaging phenotype biomarkers.  \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aDr. Shiaofen Fang is a Professor of Computer Science and the Chairman of the Department of Computer and Information Science at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI).

A smartphone is the most widely used electronic device and it is the pivot of all smart systems. However, current smartphones are not competent to manage users\u2019 sensitive data, and they are facing the privacy leakage caused by data over-collection. Data over-collection, which means smartphones apps collect users\u2019 data more than its original function while within the permission scope, is rapidly becoming one of the most serious potential security hazards in smart city. We study the current state of data over-collection and study some most frequent data over-collected cases. We present a mobile-cloud framework, which is an active approach to eradicate the data over-collection. By putting all users\u2019 data into a cloud, the security of users\u2019 data can be greatly improved. We have done extensive experiments and the experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. This research has been published in IEEE Transactions on Computers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aMeikang Qiu received the BE and ME degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and received Ph.D. degree of Computer Science from University of Texas at Dallas.

A similar observation in graphs is that some vertices are ``alike'': A set of vertices is a module if they have the same neighborhood outside this set, and they can be treated as a whole for many problems. A nice theory has been built on the properties of modules, and in particular, all the modules of a graph can be represented by a hierarchical tree structure. This provides a very handy, and sometimes indispensable, tool for solving a large family of graph problems. We survey the use of modules in bioinformatics and social networks, including both classic results and our recent ones.  \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aDr. Yixin Cao is an Assistant Professor of Computing at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

This talk will survey recently published literature along this line of research- evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization and its real-world applications. \u00a0Specifically, selection strategy, including mating selection and environmental selection, is a key ingredient in the design of evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithms. \u00a0We will provide a comprehensive analysis on the selection strategies in the current evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithms. \u00a0Experimental results on scalable DTLZ and WFG benchmark functions will demonstrate the pros and cons of various designs in terms of chosen performance metrics designed specifically for many-objective optimization.Based on performance metrics ensemble, we will provide a comprehensive measure among all competitors and more importantlyreveal insight pertaining to specific problem characteristics that each evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm could perform the best. The experimental results confirm the finding from the No Free Lunch theorem that any algorithm\u2019s elevated performance over one class of problems is exactly paid for in loss over another class.\r\n  \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1a\r\n  \r\nGary G.
