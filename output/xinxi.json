This is especially so with multiple Cloud providers with various quality of service levels. The question we address in this talk is how to provision resources to workflow-based applications where resource failures in hybrid Cloud computing systems can and do arise. We also discuss our latest work that takes into account the workload models and failure correlations to schedule workflow applications to appropriate Cloud providers. Using failure traces and workload models, we evaluated the performance and monetary cost of the proposed policies.\r\n\r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aDr. Jemal H.

By means of software tools, the application of these methods is facilitated. Over the last about half a century, CAPE (computer aided process engineering) tools have found their way into process engineering. E.g. nowadays it is unthinkable to design a plant without a simulation in a flow sheet package or its control strategies without modelling and control design tools.  \r\nThe integration of design and control, control and scheduling and design, control and scheduling, all have been core PSE challenges. While significant progress has been achieved over the years, it is fair to say that at the moment there is not a generally accepted methodology and/or \u201cprotocol\u201d for such an integration - it is also interesting to note that currently, there is not a commercially available software [or even in a prototype form] system to fully support such an activity. But there are many more applications of PSE in industry. \u00a0 \r\nIn this paper a (Finnish) perspective on industrially applied PSE is discussed. Finally industrial case studies in the area of process modelling, control and monitoring as well as fault diagnosis by the author\u2019s group are presented and evaluated. \u00a0 \r\nSirkka-Liisa J\u00e4ms\u00e4-Jounela\u6559\u6388\u82f1\u6587\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1a \r\nSirkka-Liisa J\u00e4ms\u00e4-Jounela graduated from Oulu University of Technology in 1978 where she majored in process control.

In comparison with continuous control of chaos, the discontinuous control method, which includes impulsive control, occasional bang-bang control, occasional proportional feedback and intermittent control, has attracted more interest recently due to its easy implementation in engineering control. In this talk, the recent development of discontinuous control including impulsive and intermittent control will be addressed.  \r\nTitle 2:Efficient Computation for Sparse Load Shifting in Demand Side Management(Mr. Li)  \r\nAbstract 2:In this talk, it introduces a distributed algorithm for sparse load shifting in demand-side management with a focus on the scheduling problem of residential smart appliances. Although there are many game theoretic models for the demand-side management problem, the computational efficiency of finding Nash equilibrium that globally minimizes the total energy consumption cost and the peak-to-average ratio is still an outstanding issue. We develop a bidirectional framework for solving the demand-side management problem in a distributed way to substantially improve the search efficiency. A Newton method is employed to accelerate the centralized coordination of demand side management strategies that superlinearly converge to a better Nash equilibrium minimizing the peak-to-average ratio. Furthermore, dual fast gradient and convex relaxation are applied to tackle the sub-problem for customers' best response, which is able to relieve customers' discomfort from load shifting or interrupting. Detailed results from illustrative case studies are presented and discussed, which shows the costs of energy consumption and daily peak demand by our algorithm are reduced.

A major challenge in neuroimaging visualization is how to integrate structural, functional and connectivity data to form a comprehensive visual context for data exploration, quality control, and hypothesis discovery. In this talk I will present some of our recent work on integrated visualization solution for brain imaging data by combining scientific and information visualization techniques within the context of brain anatomic structures. Several techniques will be discussed including (1) a multi-modal neuroimaging visualization tool, (2) a new surface texture technique for attribute mapping and disease features detection, (3) a new spherical volume rendering technique for generating interactive brain maps, and (4) a multi-graph technique for feature detection. This integrated visualization solution can help neuroscientists identify correlated brain regions, their activity patterns, and disease related brain connection features and imaging phenotype biomarkers.  \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aDr. Shiaofen Fang is a Professor of Computer Science and the Chairman of the Department of Computer and Information Science at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI).

A smartphone is the most widely used electronic device and it is the pivot of all smart systems. However, current smartphones are not competent to manage users\u2019 sensitive data, and they are facing the privacy leakage caused by data over-collection. Data over-collection, which means smartphones apps collect users\u2019 data more than its original function while within the permission scope, is rapidly becoming one of the most serious potential security hazards in smart city. We study the current state of data over-collection and study some most frequent data over-collected cases. We present a mobile-cloud framework, which is an active approach to eradicate the data over-collection. By putting all users\u2019 data into a cloud, the security of users\u2019 data can be greatly improved. We have done extensive experiments and the experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.

A similar observation in graphs is that some vertices are ``alike'': A set of vertices is a module if they have the same neighborhood outside this set, and they can be treated as a whole for many problems. A nice theory has been built on the properties of modules, and in particular, all the modules of a graph can be represented by a hierarchical tree structure. This provides a very handy, and sometimes indispensable, tool for solving a large family of graph problems. We survey the use of modules in bioinformatics and social networks, including both classic results and our recent ones.  \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1aDr. Yixin Cao is an Assistant Professor of Computing at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

This talk will survey recently published literature along this line of research- evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization and its real-world applications. \u00a0Specifically, selection strategy, including mating selection and environmental selection, is a key ingredient in the design of evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithms. \u00a0We will provide a comprehensive analysis on the selection strategies in the current evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithms. \u00a0Experimental results on scalable DTLZ and WFG benchmark functions will demonstrate the pros and cons of various designs in terms of chosen performance metrics designed specifically for many-objective optimization.Based on performance metrics ensemble, we will provide a comprehensive measure among all competitors and more importantlyreveal insight pertaining to specific problem characteristics that each evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm could perform the best. The experimental results confirm the finding from the No Free Lunch theorem that any algorithm\u2019s elevated performance over one class of problems is exactly paid for in loss over another class.\r\n  \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1a\r\n  \r\nGary G.

Developing effective computational models to integrate vast amount of heterogeneous biological data for the identification of potential disease-lncRNA associations has become a hot topic in the fields of human complex diseases and lncRNAs,which could benefit lncRNA biomarker detection for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. In this talk, I will introduce some state-of-the-art computational models for lncRNA-disease association prediction. \u00a0 \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1a \u00a0 \r\n\u9648\u5174\uff0c2007\u5e74\u672c\u79d1\u6bd5\u4e1a\u4e8e\u5c71\u4e1c\u5927\u5b66\uff0c2012\u5e74\u83b7\u5f97\u4e2d\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u9662\u6570\u5b66\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u9662\u535a\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\uff1b\u73b0\u4efb\u4e2d\u79d1\u9662\u6570\u5b66\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u9662\u548c\u4e2d\u79d1\u9662\u56fd\u5bb6\u6570\u5b66\u4e0e\u4ea4\u53c9\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5fc3\u52a9\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5458.\u81f3\u4eca\u5728Nucleic Acids Research\u3001Bioinformatics\u3001Scientific reports\u3001Briefings in Bioinformatics\u3001Oncotarget\u7b49\u56fd\u9645\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e3b\u6d41\u671f\u520a\u4ee5\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u901a\u8baf\u4f5c\u8005\u8eab\u4efd\u53d1\u8868\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u8bba\u658724\u7bc7\uff08SCI\u8bba\u658720\u7bc7\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u5b50\u7d2f\u8ba1\u8d85\u8fc796\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f5c\u800518\u7bc7,\u901a\u8baf\u4f5c\u800515\u7bc7\uff0c\u53d1\u8868\u8bba\u6587\u76ee\u524d\u5171\u88ab\u5f15\u7528419\u6b21\uff0c\u53c2\u7f16\u4e13\u84574\u90e8\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6388\u6743\u4e13\u52291\u9879\uff0c\u66fe\u83b7\u56fd\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5927\u4f1a\u6700\u4f73\u8bba\u6587\u5956\u3001\u7b2c\u56db\u5c4a\u4e16\u754c\u534e\u4eba\u6570\u5b66\u5bb6\u5927\u4f1a\u65b0\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u5b66\u5956\u3001\u4e2d\u79d1\u9662\u6570\u5b66\u9662\u9662\u957f\u5956\u5b66\u91d1\u7b49\u8363\u8a89\uff0c\u4e3b\u6301\u6216\u4ee5\u9aa8\u5e72\u8eab\u4efd\u53c2\u4e0e\u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1\u91cd\u5927\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u57f9\u80b2\u9879\u76ee\u3001\u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1\u9752\u5e74\u57fa\u91d1\u3001\u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1\u4e13\u9879\u57fa\u91d1\u9879\u76ee\u6570\u5b66\u5929\u5143\u57fa\u91d1\u7b4911\u9879\u91cd\u8981\u9879\u76ee.\u62c5\u4efb29\u5bb6\u56fd\u9645\u4e3b\u6d41\u6742\u5fd7\u7684\u7f16\u59d4\u3001\u7279\u7ea6\u7f16\u59d4\u548c\u5ba1\u7a3f\u4eba.\u4ece\u4e8b\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5229\u7528\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u56fe\u8bba\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u75be\u75c5\u3001\u975e\u7f16\u7801RNA\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u836f\u7406\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55. \u00a0", "type": "\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u7c7b"},

However, this approach assumes that all the followers know the system matrix of the leader system, and this assumption may not be desirable in some applications. In this talk, we will further introduce an adaptive distributed observer, which is able to provide the estimation of the leader\u2019s dynamics and thus does not need the assumption that all the followers know the system matrix of the leader system.We then further present some applications of the adaptive distributed observer to several cooperative control problemsofmulti-agent systems such as the leader-following consensus problem, the cooperativeoutput regulation problem,rendezvous, and flocking. \u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\u9ec4\u6377\u6559\u6388\u82f1\u6587\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1a \r\nJie Huang isChoh-Ming Li Professor of Mechanical and Automation Engineering and Chairmanofthe Department ofMechanicaland Automation Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong.He served as a Science Advisor to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Honorary Advisor to Hong Kong Science Museum .His research interests include automatic control, robotics and automation, systems biology, and guidance and control of flight vehicles.

Its transparent philosophy and design idea have been the principles to system design and implementation, in particular to those lightweight mobile device based service systems. One of the significant features is that with only one lightweight terminal, a user can receive heterogeneous services without care of required OSes and APPs. Cyber-I (Cyber Individual) refers to a Real-I\u2019s digital clone, namely, a comprehensive human digital model with which human centered, personalized, and empathetic services are aimed. Cyber-I can grow towards approximating Real-I\u2019s actual features by continuously collecting, integrating, and mining scattered personal big data. In this talk, I will describe a TC and Cyber-I based ubiquitous transparent service framework, demonstrate its application to TC-iWatch, and address its challenges. \u00a0 \r\n\u9ec4\u6559\u6388\u4e2a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\u4e2a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb:\u00a0 \r\nDr. Runhe Huang received her B.Sc. in Electronics Technology from National University of Defense Technology, China, in 1982, and her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of the West of England, UK, in 1993.

We used the Wnt1CreandWnt1Cre2SORdrivers to conditionally ablate both YapandTazin the CNC of mice.When using either Cre driver, YapandTazdeficiency in the CNC resulted inenlarged, hemorrhaging branchial arch blood vessels and hydrocephalus. However,Wnt1Cre2SORembryos had an open cranial neural tube phenotype that was not evident inWnt1Creembryos.InO9-1 CNC cells, the loss ofYapimpairedsmooth muscle cell differentiation. RNA-sequencing data indicated that Yapand Taz regulate genes encoding Fox transcription factors, specifically Foxc1.Proliferationwas reduced in the branchial arch mesenchyme ofYapandTazCNC conditional knockout (CKO) embryos. Moreover,YapandTazCKO embryos had cerebellar aplasia similar to Dandy Walker spectrum malformations observed in human patients and mouse embryos with mutations inFoxc1. Inembryos and O9-1 cells deficient forYapandTaz,Foxc1expression was significantly reduced.Analysis ofFoxc1regulatory regions revealed a conserved recognition element for the Yap and Taz DNA binding co-factor Tead. ChIP-PCR experiments further supported the conclusion thatFoxc1is directly regulated by the Yap/Teadcomplex.Our findings uncover important roles forYapandTazin CNC diversification and development.  \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1a\u738b\u4fca\u535a\u58eb2010\u5e74\u83b7\u7f8e\u56fd\u5fb7\u5dde\u519c\u5de5\u5927\u5b66\u5065\u5eb7\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533b\u5b66\u79d1\u5b66\u535a\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\uff0c2014\u5e74\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u8d1d\u52d2\u533b\u5b66\u9662\u7ed3\u675f\u535a\u58eb\u540e\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u7559\u4efb\u52a9\u7406\u6559\u6388\u3002\u738b\u4fca\u535a\u58eb\u957f\u671f\u4ece\u4e8b\u5fc3\u810f\u53d1\u80b2\u548c\u5fc3\u810f\u75be\u75c5\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u8bba\u658716\u7bc7\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4f5c7\u7bc7\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u8868\u5728Developmental Cell\u3001PNAS\u3001Plos Genetics\u53caScience\u7b49\u56fd\u9645\u6838\u5fc3\u671f\u520a\uff0c\u5171\u88ab\u5f15\u7528\u8fd1700\u6b21\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u738b\u4fca\u535a\u58eb\u8fd8\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u591a\u672c\u5fc3\u810f\u53d1\u80b2\u4e66\u7c4d\u7f16\u5199\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u9080\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fd\u9645\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e0a\u505a\u5927\u4f1a\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u738b\u4fca\u535a\u58eb\u73b0\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u53d1\u80b2\u534f\u4f1a\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u534f\u4f1a\u4f1a\u5458\u548c\u6069\u79d1\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u7814\u7a76\u9662\u7ec8\u8eab\u4f1a\u5458\uff0c2014Rolanette and Berdon Lawrence\u5956\u83b7\u5f97\u8005\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5fc3\u810f\u534f\u4f1aSDG\u9879\u76ee\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\u3002  \r\n\u4e2a\u4eba\u7f51\u9875\uff1ahttps://www.bcm.edu/people/view/b19073fb-ffed-11e2-be68-080027880ca6\u00a0", "type": "\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u7c7b"},

Services in the cloud computing networks may be virtualized with specific servers which host abstracted details. Some of the servers are active and available, while others are busy or heavy loaded, and the remaining are offline for various reasons. Users would expect the right and available servers to complete their application requirements. Therefore, in order to provide an effective control scheme with parameter guidance for cloud resource services, failure detection is essential tomeet users service expectations. It can resolve possible performance bottlenecks in providing the virtual service for the cloud computing networks. Most \u00a0 \r\nexisting Failure Detector (FD) schemes do not automatically adjust their detection service parameters for the dynamic network conditions, thus they couldn't be used for actual application. \u00a0 \r\n\u00a0 \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1a \u00a0 \r\n\u718a\u4e43\u5b66\u535a\u58eb\u662f\u7f8e\u4e1c\u79d1\u6280\u6280\u672f\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u3001\u603b\u88c1\u3002\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f50\u6cbb\u4e9a\u5dde\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7cfb\u3001\u79d1\u7f57\u62c9\u591a\u7406\u5de5\u5927\u5b66\uff08\u6b63\u6559\u6388\uff0c\u79d1\u7f57\u62c9\u591a\u5dde\uff0c\u65bd\u666e\u6797\u65bd\u5e02\uff0c\u662f\u79d1\u7814\u578b\u5927\u5b66\uff09\u4efb\u6559\u8fd110\u5e74\u3002\u66fe\u83b7\u5f97\u4e2d\u56fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5b66\u4f1a\u4f18\u79c0\u535a\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\u8bba\u6587\u5956\u63d0\u540d\uff0c\u5728IEEE JSAC\u3001IEEE Transactions, ACM Transactions, Information Science\u3001IEEE INFOCOM\u3001IEEE LCN\u3001IEEE IPDPS\u7b49\u6742\u5fd7\u671f\u520a\u4ee5\u53ca\u56fd\u9645\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e0a\u53d1\u8868\u8bba\u6587\u8fd1500\u7bc7\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u671f\u520a\u7ea6250\u7bc7\u3002 \u00a0 \r\n\u718a\u4e43\u5b66\u6559\u6388\u5df2\u5728\u8fd1\u767e\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u56fd\u9645\u5927\u4f1a\u4e0a\u4efb\u5927\u4f1a\u603b\u4e3b\u5e2d\uff0c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u4e3b\u5e2d\uff0c\u5206\u4f1a\u4e3b\u5e2d\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6216\u7a0b\u5e8f\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u59d4\u5458\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982Infocomm, IPDPS, CloudComputing, ICA3PP, 3PGCIC, ICISE, ICISE, PICom\u548cUNC\u7b49\u3002\u4ed6\u662fIEEE\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u4e3b\u5e2d\uff08Chair of Trust Cloud Computing\uff09\uff0c\u66fe\u62c5\u4efb\u7f8e\u56fdIEEE\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5b66\u4f1a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u79d8\u4e66\uff08IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (IEEE TCSC)\uff09\u3002\u4e5f\u662f\u7f8e\u56fdIEEE\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5b66\u4f1aIEEE-CS Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP)\uff0cIEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS): Intelligent Systems Applications\uff0cIEEE Computer Society\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4f1a\u5458\u3002 \u00a0 \r\n\u718a\u4e43\u5b66\u6559\u6388\u4e5f\u662f\u56fd\u9645\u6838\u5fc3\u671f\u520aJournal of Internet Technology (JIT, SCIE\u68c0\u7d22)\u548cJournal of parallel and cloud computing (PCC,\u7b2c1\u4e2a\u4e91\u671f\u520a)\u7684\u4e3b\u7f16\uff0c \u56fd\u9645\u6838\u5fc3\u671f\u520aInformation Science\uff08\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u5b503.6\uff0cSCI\uff09\u548c \u56fd\u9645\u6838\u5fc3\u671f\u520aIEEE Transactions on Systems, men, cybernetic: systems\u7684\u526f\u4e3b\u7f16\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u6838\u5fc3\u671f\u520a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b66\u62a5\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u4ed6\u5148\u540e\u4e5f\u662f\u5176\u5b83\u5341\u591a\u4e2a\u56fd\u9645\u671f\u520a\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u89c1\u7b80\u5386\uff09\uff0c\u88ab\u9080\u8bf7\u7ed9\u8fd1100\u4e2a\u671f\u520a\u505a\u4e3a\u4f5c\u5ba2\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5305\u62ecIEEE Transactions on Communications, IEEE Transactions On Mobile Computing\u7b49100\u79cd\u671f\u520a\u6742\u5fd7\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u6709\uff1a\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5bb9\u9519\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u3002 \u00a0 \r\n\u718a\u4e43\u5b66\u6559\u6388\u5e94\u9080\u5728\u4e8c\u5341\u591a\u4e2a\u5b66\u672f\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u4e0a\u4f5c\u4e86\u4e3b\u9898\u6f14\u8bb2(keynote speech),\u5e76\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u548c\u8bb8\u591a\u4e16\u754c\u8457\u540d\u5927\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u9080\u5b66\u672f\u62a5\u544a,\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u7f8e\u56fdTemple\u5927\u5b66\u3001\u4e2d\u79d1\u9662\u3001\u4e0a\u6d77\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u5b66\u3001\u53ca\u6e05\u534e\u5927\u5b66\u7b49\u3002\u718a\u4e43\u5b66\u535a\u58eb\u5df2\u4e0e\u7f8e\u56fd\u3001\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u3001\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u3001\u82f1\u56fd\u3001\u5e0c\u814a\u3001\u4e2d\u56fd\u9999\u6e2f\u7b49\u5730\u7684\u6559\u6388\u53ca\u7814\u7a76\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u3002 \u00a0", "type": "\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u7c7b"},

Based on this inevitable urbanization, my research aims to address sustainability challenges related to urban mobility (e.g., energy consumption and traffic congestion) by data-driven applications with a Cyber-Physical-Systems approach (CPS, also known as a broader term for Internet of Things), which is a new information paradigm integrating communication, computation and control in real time. Under the context of a smart cities initiative proposed by the White House, in this talk, I will focus on CPS related to large-scale cross-domain urban systems, e.g., taxi, bus, subway, cellphone and smart payment systems. I will first show how cross-domain data from these systems can be collaboratively utilized to capture urban mobility in real time by a new technique called multi-view bounding, which addresses overfitting issues of existing mobility models driven by single-domain data. Then I will show how the captured real-time mobility can be used to design a practical service, i.e., mobility-driven ridesharing, to provide positive feedback to urban systems themselves, e.g., reducing energy consumption and traffic congestion. Finally, I will present real-world impact of my research and some future work about CPS for smart cities.\u00a0 \r\n\u62a5\u544a\u4eba\u7b80\u4ecb\uff1a\u00a0 \r\nDr. Tian He is currently an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.
